'PNGQuant Interface (formerly pngnq-s9 interface)
'Copyright 2012-2015 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 19/December/12
'Last updated: 02/July/14
'Last update: migrate all plugin support to the official pngquant library.  Work on pngnq-s9 has pretty much
'              evaporated since late 2012, so pngquant is the new workhorse for PD's specialized PNG needs.
'
'Module for handling all PNGQuant interfacing.  This module is pointless without the accompanying
' PNGQuant plugin, which will be in the App/PhotoDemon/Plugins subdirectory as "pngquant.exe"
'
'PNGQuant is a free, open-source lossy PNG compression library.  You can learn more about it here:
'
' http://pngquant.org/
'
'PhotoDemon has been designed against v2.1.1 (02 July '14).  It may not work with other versions.
' Additional documentation regarding the use of PNGQuant is available as part of the official PNGQuant library,
' downloadable from http://pngquant.org/.
